name=80% Battery Charge Limit for Snapdragon-based Xiaomi/Redmi/POCO (a.k.a Night Charging)
version=v1
versionCode=1
author=mge-hsl
description=By default, MIUI/HyperOS does not have the option in the settings (or anywhere in its UI) to limit battery charging, but it also ships with '/sys/class/qcom-battery/night_charging' file, which does that but, there's no way to turn it on out of the box. This is where this module comes in.
